Workflow of the Linear Regression Model:

Step 1:  Set Hyperparameters (Learning Rate, Number of Iterations); Initiate random weight and bias value.

Step 2:  Build Linear Regression Equation (y = wx + b), where w = weight, b = bias

Step 3: Find the "y pred" value for the given x value and the corresponding weight & bias.

Step 4: Check the loss function. (difference between "predicted y value" and "true y value")

Step 5: Update the parameter values using Gradient Descent. (new weight & bias value)

Step 6: Steps 3, 4, and 5 are repeated until the minimum loss function is achieved.

And finally, we get the best model.
