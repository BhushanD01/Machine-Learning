# Machine-Learning

This repository documents my journey of learning **Machine Learning** through hands-on coding.
The goal of this repo is simple:
- Learn ML concepts step by step 🧠
- Implement ideas in code 🧪
- Create a long-term reference for myself (and others) 📂

Example topics include:
- Vectors & Matrix Operations
- Linear & Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- Model evaluation
- And more as I progress

This is a learning repository, not a production-ready ML library.
Expect experimentation, refactoring, and gradual improvement 🚧

Feel free to explore, fork, or use this repo as inspiration for your own learning journey 🌱
