Workflow of the Logistic Regression Model:

Step 1: Set Learning Rate & Number of Iterations; Initiate random weight and bias value.

Step 2: Build Logistic Regression Function (Sigmoid Function)

Step 3: Update the parameters using gradient descent.

We will get the best model (best weight and bias value), which will have the minimum cost function.

Step 4: Build the "predict" function to determine the class of the function.
